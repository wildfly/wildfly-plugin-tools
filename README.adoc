= WildFly Plugins Tools
:toc:

The WildFly Plugins Tools offers some simple API's for deploying applications to http://wildfly.org[WildFly] or https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform[JBoss EAP] and tooling around provisioning a server.

== Deployment Manager

The deployment manager can be used to deploy or redeploy content to a running server as well as undeploy content. It works with both standalone servers and managed domains.

A simple example is deploying a WAR from the file system.
[source,java]
----
final Path deploymentPath = Paths.get(System.getProperty("user.home"), "projects", "myapp", "target", "myapp.war");
try (final ModelControllerClient client = ModelControllerClient.Factory.create(InetAddress.getLocalHost(), 9990)) {
    final DeploymentManager deploymentManager = DeploymentManager.create(client);
    final Deployment deployment = Deployment.of(deploymentPath);
    deploymentManager.forceDeploy(deployment).assertSuccess();
}
----

You can also deploy an input stream.
[source,java]
----
final String deploymentName = "example.war";
final WebArchive archive = ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class, deploymentName);
archive.add(EmptyAsset.INSTANCE, "META-INF/beans.xml");
archive.addPackage("org.jboss.example");
try (final ModelControllerClient client = ModelControllerClient.Factory.create(InetAddress.getLocalHost(), 9990)) {
    final DeploymentManager deploymentManager = DeploymentManager.create(client);
    final Deployment deployment = Deployment.of(archive.as(ZipExporter.class).exportAsInputStream(), deploymentName);
    deploymentManager.forceDeploy(deployment).assertSuccess();
}
----

[source,java]
.Managed Domain Example
----
final Path deploymentPath = Paths.get(System.getProperty("user.home"), "projects", "myapp", "target", "myapp.war");
try (final ModelControllerClient client = ModelControllerClient.Factory.create(InetAddress.getLocalHost(), 9990)) {
    final DeploymentManager deploymentManager = DeploymentManager.create(client);
    final Deployment deployment = Deployment.of(deploymentPath)
        .addServerGroups("main-server-group", "other-server-group");
    deploymentManager.deploy(deployment).assertSuccess();
}
----

[source,java]
.Redeploy Example
----
final Path deploymentPath = Paths.get(System.getProperty("user.home"), "projects", "myapp", "target", "myapp.war");
try (final ModelControllerClient client = ModelControllerClient.Factory.create(InetAddress.getLocalHost(), 9990)) {
    final DeploymentManager deploymentManager = DeploymentManager.create(client);
    if (deploymentManager.hasDeployment(deploymentPath.getFileName().toString())) {
        deploymentManager.redeploy(Deployment.of(deploymentPath)).assertSuccess();
    }
}
----

[source,java]
.Undeploy Example
----
try (final ModelControllerClient client = ModelControllerClient.Factory.create(InetAddress.getLocalHost(), 9990)) {
    final DeploymentManager deploymentManager = DeploymentManager.create(client);
    final DeploymentResult result = deploymentManager.undeploy(UndeployDescription.of("example.war").setFailOnMissing(true));
    if (!result.successful()) {
        logger.errorf("Failed to undeploy example.war. %s", result.getFailureMessage());
    }
}
----

== Deployment Operation Helper

There is a helper if you'd rather execute operations on your own as well using the `org.wildfly.plugin.core.DeploymentOperations`.

[source,java]
----
final Path deploymentPath = Paths.get(System.getProperty("user.home"), "projects", "myapp", "target", "myapp.war");
try (final ModelControllerClient client = ModelControllerClient.Factory.create(InetAddress.getLocalHost(), 9990)) {
    final Operation op = DeploymentOperations.createDeployOperation(Deployment.of(deploymentPath));
    final ModelNode outcome = client.execute(op);
    if (!Operations.isSuccessfulOutcome(outcome)) {
        throw new DeploymentException(Operations.getFailureDescription(outcome).asString());
    }
}
----

== Server Utilities

You can also use the `org.wildfly.plugin.tools.server.DomainManager`,  `org.wildfly.plugin.tools.server.ServerManager`
and `org.wildfly.plugin.tools.server.StandaloneManager` utilities to interact with a running server or start a server.

=== Starting a Server

Below is an example of starting a server and using the `ServerManager` to interact with the server and deploy an
application.

[source,java]
----
final Path wildflyHome = Paths.get(System.getProperty("user.home"), "servers", "wildfly-33.0.0.Final");
try (StandaloneManager serverManager = ServerManager.of(Configuration.create(StandaloneCommandBuilder.of(wildflyHome)))) {
    // Wait at the maximum 30 seconds for the server to start
    serverManager.start(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    final Path deploymentPath = Paths.get(System.getProperty("user.home"), "projects", "myapp", "target", "myapp.war");
    final DeploymentManager deploymentManager = serverManager.deploymentManager();
    final Deployment deployment = Deployment.of(deploymentPath);
    deploymentManager.forceDeploy(deployment).assertSuccess();
}
----

=== Managing an Already Running Server

Below is an example of creating a `ServerManger` to interact with an already running server.

[source,java]
----
try (ServerManager serverManager = ServerManager.builder().build().get(60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
    LOGGER.infof("Managing %s", serverManager.containerDescription());
    final Path deploymentPath = Paths.get(System.getProperty("user.home"), "projects", "myapp", "target", "myapp.war");
    final DeploymentManager deploymentManager = serverManager.deploymentManager();
    final Deployment deployment = Deployment.of(deploymentPath);
    deploymentManager.forceDeploy(deployment).assertSuccess();
}
----

== Releasing

Releasing the project requires permission to deploy to Maven Central see https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/[Maven Central Release Requirements].
Once everything is setup, you simply need to run the `./release.sh` script. There are two required parameters:

1. `-r` or `--release` which is the version you want to release
2. `-d` or `--development` which is the next development version.

By default the release version cannot contain `SNAPSHOT` and the development version, must container `SNAPSHOT`.

[source,bash]
.Example Command
----
./release -r 1.0.0.Final -d 1.0.1.Final-SNAPSHOT
----

=== Supported Arguments

|===
|Argument | Requires Value | Description

| `-d`, `--development`
| Yes
| The next version for the development cycle.

| `-f`, `--force`
| No
| Forces to allow a SNAPSHOT suffix in release version and not require one for the development version.

| `-h`, `--help`
| No
| Displays this help

| `-r`, `--release`
| Yes
| The version to be released. Also used for the tag.

| `--dry-run`
| No
| Executes the release in as a dry-run. Nothing will be updated or pushed.

| `-v`, `--verbose`
| No
| Prints verbose output.

|===


Any additional arguments are considered arguments for the Maven command.
